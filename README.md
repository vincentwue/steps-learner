# Musical scale steps learner

"It is important to learn all the modes in every key all over your guitar.
Its a big order.
But in order to be free with that information technically,
you have to get passed this memorization state,
you have to get pass the visualisation state,
and then you have to get past the whole concept of
why you'd want to recognize a modal position
that you're in and then how you would react to it again."
- Joe Satrian

This small app helps me with learning this awesome shit.

It simply shows a key and a step of the scale.

The magic begins when we randomly change both.

You can start very small with one key and two steps or so.

And build up your skills gradually.

Also, you can choose the time interval for the random changes.

## Features and Development

The small app grows with my own learning process.

Feel free to ask for specific features,
maybe I find them useful and want to implement them.

Stay tuned.
